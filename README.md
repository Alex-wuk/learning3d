# Learning3D: A Modern Library for Deep Learning on 3D Point Clouds Data.

**[Documentation]() | [Quick Start]() | [Python]() | [Demo]()**

Learning3D is an open-source library that supports the development of deep learning algorithms that deal with 3D data. The Learning3D exposes a set of state of art deep neural networks in python. A modular code has been provided for further development. We welcome contributions from the open-source community.
